# Unreal-Engine-Widget-Spline-System

Unreal-Engine-Widget-Spline-System is a free and open-source plugin for Unreal Engine that introduces a powerful spline widget. With this widget, developers can effortlessly draw 2D lines which can be edited both in the UMG editor and during runtime.

## Features

- **Versatile Drawing Modes**: Draw either straight lines or bezier splines in 2D space.
- **UMG Editor Integration**: Edit and preview the spline right in the UMG editor.
- **Independent Editing Interface**: I have designed a unique interface that makes the spline incredibly easy to modify.
- **Custom Brushes**: Allows for unique brush implementations on the spline geometry.
- **Widget Rails**: Use the spline as a guiding rail for other widgets, much like the USplineComponent operates in 3D space.
- **Runtime Editing**: Flexibility is key. Edit the spline conveniently during game runtime.
- **Demo Level**: Not sure where to start? Check out the included demo level to see an example of integration.
